      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p property="text">
        Gezr is a web application that has the purpose of creating a small structure out of Webcam-captured video-streams,
        by detecting, classifying and comparing hand/arm gestures of users, providing also information about rules resulted
        from the input gesture.
        Simple users will connect to the application with camera on and they could see, by request, gestures data resulted until that point and,
        eventually, they can start a quiz game.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p property="text">
        This guide shows how the user interacts with GEZR application, providing details about the overall design of
        the application and the actions that are exposed to the end user.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p property="text">
        When accessing the application, the user is shown directly the main page that contains the Webcam streams already processed, showing
        the landmarks of the hand, when one or many are found in video, and the gesture found by the application on the first hand.
        Once the main page is accessed, the gestures found are also registered by the application for future references.
        At this moment, the user can start a quiz game, where he could answer with true or false only through gestures, or
        he could cause the triggering of a rule, like certain gestures opening a new tab in the current browser or stop recording data. All the registered gestures
        can also be seen in the statistics tab.

      <section id="question">
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          The questions are such that they can be answered only true or false, and for this the user will have 10 seconds 
          per question to show to the camera thumbs up (for at least 5 seconds), if he considers the statement to be true, and thumbs down if who considers it false.
          Before the game starts a popup will appear to specify the constraints of the game. After confirmation, a box corresponding to each 
          question will appear under the camera. After answering the questions, a new popup will appear to specify for each question whether 
          it was answered correctly, by coloring the answer it in blue, or incorrectly, in red.

        <p>
          If the user wants to temporarily or permanently stop storing data about gestures made to the camera, it is necessary to wave to the camera 
          for more than 5 seconds. At this point a popup will appear and, with the user's consent, the recording will be stopped. During this time,
          question-type games will not be active, as well with other rules.
          Still, during this period the gestures can still be viewed realtime in the camera.
